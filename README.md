#Git+GitHUb is the best approach for version controlling, used by majority of programmers
#users can work locally or remotely
#there are 3 stages for changes: working directory, stagging and repository (production)
#basic commands: for local - add, commit, status, log and for remote - push, fetch, merge, pull
#things can be resolved easily before commit, so pay attention to what is committed
#if the guidelines are followed (commits are relevant with the right message, conflicts are resolved correctly and there are no branches and changes without a purpose) - then no problem :)
